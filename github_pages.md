## About GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. You can see examples of GitHub Pages sites in the [GitHub Pages examples collection](https://github.com/collections/github-pages-examples).

## Types of GitHub Pages sites

There are two types of GitHub Pages sites. Sites associated with a user or organization account, and sites for a specific project.

### Hosting on your own custom domain

You can host your site on GitHub's `github.io` domain or your own custom domain. See [Configuring a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

## Data collection

When a GitHub Pages site is visited, the visitor's IP address is logged and stored for security purposes, regardless of whether the visitor has signed into GitHub or not. For more information about GitHub's security practices, see [GitHub Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).
